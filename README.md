# FlappyBird-AI

### What is Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT)?
NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) is a genetic algorithm for the generation of 
evolving artificial neural networks. It alters both the weighting parameters and structures of networks, 
attempting to find a balance between the fitness of evolved solutions and their diversity. It is based 
on applying three key techniques: tracking genes with history markers to allow crossover among 
topologies, applying speciation (the evolution of species) to preserve innovations, and 
developing topologies incrementally from simple initial structures ("complexifying"). 

### Running the project
You can run this project on repl.it by clicking the above badge or you can download the source code and run `flappy_bird.py`.

### Implementation
This project recreated the game "Flappy Bird" using pygame and uses the 
NEAT python module to teach an AI how to play "Flappy Bird".
